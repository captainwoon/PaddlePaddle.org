# PaddlePaddle.org's content + API documentation generator

This repo contains all the tools to generate the English and Chinese version of the official website for [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) (an easy-to-use, efficient, and scalable distributed deep learning platform). Tied with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), these tools augment [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)'s documentation generation capabilities.

The tutorials here guide you to setup the website locally, so you can see exactly how your contributions will appear on [paddlepaddle.org](http://paddlepaddle.org).


## Installation

1. **Since this repo does not hold the content rendered on website, download / clone ONLY the relevant repos with content and code that you want to update and test (if you don't already have them):**
   - [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle) (contains all articles AND codebase to render the API documentation)
   - [Book](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/book) (contains chapter pages)
   - [Models](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/models) (contains the code to build models for different applications, including a few articles)
   - [Mobile](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/mobile) (contains articles for building for mobile)

   You can place these anywhere on the computer; at a later step we will tell PaddlePaddle.org where they are.


2. **Pull PaddlePaddle.org into a new directory and install its dependencies.**

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:PaddlePaddle/PaddlePaddle.org.git
    cd portal
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *Optional: If you plan on translating website content between English and Chinese for improving PaddlePaddle.org, install [GNU gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) too.*


3. **Run PaddlePaddle.org locally.**

    Pass the list of directories you wish to load and build content from (options include `--paddle`, `--book`, `--models`, and `--mobile`)
    ```
    ./runserver --paddle <path_to_paddle_dir> --book <path_to_book_dir>
    ```

    Open up your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
    **NOTE**: *Links may take a few seconds to load the first time around since they are probably being built.*


## Writing new content

All repositories support content contribution formatted as [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (the GitHub flavor). The Paddle repo, where majority of the documentation lies, also support the [reStructured Text](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) format.

After you have gone through the installation steps above, here are the steps you need to take:

- Before you start writing, we recommend reviewing these [guidelines on contributing content]().
- Create a new `.md` (or `.rst`, only in the case of Paddle) file OR edit an existing article's file within the appropriate directory of the repo you are contributing to.
- To view the changes in your browser, click **Regenerate** on the top-righthand side corner.
- To add it to a menu or change its position on the menu, click on the **Edit menu** button at the top of the left-handside menu on the page, to open the menu editor.


## Writing or modifying the Python API

After you have built your new `pybind` targets, and have tested your new Python API, you can continue with testing how your documentation strings and comments show up:

- We recommend reviewing these [guidelines on contributing API documentation]().
- On the specific "API" page you wish to update, click **Regenerate** on the top-righthand side corner.
- To add it to a menu or change its position on the menu, click on the **Edit menu** button at the top of the left-handside menu on the page, to open the menu editor.

## Writing or modifying APIs

There are two kinds of API updates you can make: the Python API for users, and the list of available operators. Before you are ready to test how your documentation strings and comments show, we recommend reviewing these [guidelines on contributing API documentation]().


### Python API updates

- On the specific "API" page you wish to update, click **Regenerate** on the top-righthand side corner.
- To add it to a menu or change its position on the menu, click on the **Edit menu** button at the top of the left-handside menu on the page, to open the menu editor.


### Operators updates

If you have added or removed operators, or made changes to their "RDOC", after you build your new `pybind` targets, also build the `operators`
